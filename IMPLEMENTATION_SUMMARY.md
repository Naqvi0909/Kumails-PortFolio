## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of models, views, and services
- **Session Management**: Context manager for automatic commit/rollback
- **Absolute Imports**: No relative imports; works as both module and script
- **Type Hints**: Modern Python with `from __future__ import annotations`

### Database Design
- **Normalized Schema**: Proper foreign keys and constraints
- **Double-Entry Invariant**: Check constraint on postings
- **Unique Constraints**: Period closures prevent duplicates
- **Cascades**: Delete postings when transaction deleted

### UI/UX
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid and box layouts for flexibility
- **Immediate Feedback**: Status labels update after operations
- **Batch Operations**: Apply rules to hundreds of transactions
- **Visual Charts**: PyQtGraph for fast, interactive visualizations

### Data Engineering
- **CSV Flexibility**: Column mapping for various bank formats
- **Date Parsing**: Multi-format support with error handling
- **Regex Power**: Full regex support for categorization
- **Aggregations**: Efficient SQL queries for reports

- **Schema Design**: Normalized, constrained, indexed

### 3. Full-Stack Desktop
- **Backend**: SQLAlchemy ORM, session management, transactions
- **Frontend**: PySide6 with custom widgets, tables, charts

## Key Talking Points

### "Why Python + SQL?"
> "I work as a data engineer for a bank, so Python and SQL are my core stack. I wanted to showcase both data engineering (ETL, schema design, aggregations) and application development (desktop UI, business logic, packaging)."

### "Why Desktop vs Web?"
> "Desktop apps are underrated in portfolios. This demonstrates native UI development, local-first data, and packaging for distribution—skills that differentiate me from web-only developers."

### "Why Double-Entry Bookkeeping?"
> "It shows domain knowledge in finance. Every transaction creates balanced postings (debit = credit), which is how banks and accounting systems work. It's a differentiator for fintech roles."

### "What was the hardest part?"
> "Balancing import flexibility (various CSV formats) with data validation. I built a preview system so users can verify mappings before importing. The rules engine was also complex—regex matching, priority ordering, dry-run testing."

### "How does this relate to your bank role?"
> "In banking, data quality is critical. This app demonstrates validation, audit trails, reconciliation—all key concepts in financial data pipelines. The rules engine mirrors fraud detection patterns."
