# Personal Finance Reconciliation App

A local-first desktop application for managing personal finances with double-entry bookkeeping, transaction categorization, and visual reporting.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented (Days 1-5)

- **ðŸŽ¨ Modern Dashboard**: Colorful gradient UI with live stat cards and separate chart windows
- **ðŸ“¥ Import Wizard**: Import CSV bank statements with column mapping and preview
- **ðŸ’³ Transaction Management**: View and categorize transactions with inline editing
- **ðŸŽ¯ Rules Engine**: Create categorization rules with regex patterns and amount ranges
- **ðŸ“Š Double-Entry Postings**: Automatic generation of balanced ledger entries
- **ðŸ“ˆ Reports**: Cashflow, category breakdown, account balances, and reconciliation reports
- **ðŸ“Š Interactive Charts**: Separate chart windows with modern PyQtGraph visualizations
- **ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI**: Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and responsive design

## Tech Stack

- **UI Framework**: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Charts**: PyQtGraph for interactive visualizations
- **Data Processing**: pandas for CSV import
- **Packaging**: PyInstaller for Windows .exe distribution

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- pip

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd P#1
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run the App

```bash
python finance_app/main.py
```

Or use the entry point:
```bash
python run.py
```

### Demo the Modern UI

```bash
python demo_modern_ui.py
```

This launches the app with a showcase of the modern UI features.

### First Steps

1. **Import Transactions**:
   - Go to the Import tab
   - Click "Browse CSVâ€¦" and select a bank statement (sample data in `sample_data/`)
   - Map columns: date, description, amount
   - Enter source account name (e.g., "Checking")
   - Preview and click "Import"

2. **Create Categorization Rules**:
   - Go to the Rules tab
   - Click "Add Rule"
   - Enter regex pattern (e.g., `grocery|walmart|target` for groceries)
   - Set category ID
   - Optionally set amount min/max
   - Click "Apply Rules" to categorize transactions

3. **View Transactions**:
   - Go to the Transactions tab
   - Edit categories inline using dropdowns
   - Click "Save Changes"

4. **Generate Postings**:
   - Go to the Reports tab
   - Click "Generate All Postings" to create double-entry bookkeeping entries

5. **View Dashboard**:
   - Go to Dashboard tab
   - Select time range (Last Month, Quarter, Year, All Time)
   - View cashflow and category breakdown charts

## Sample Data

Two sample CSV files are included in `sample_data/`:
- `bank_statement_1.csv` (October 2024)
- `bank_statement_2.csv` (September 2024)

Both contain realistic transaction data including:
- Salary deposits
- Rent payments
- Grocery purchases
- Utility bills
- Dining and shopping expenses

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

- **accounts**: Asset, liability, income, expense accounts
- **transactions**: Imported financial transactions
- **categories**: Hierarchical expense/income categories
- **postings**: Double-entry ledger entries (debit/credit)
- **rules**: Regex-based categorization rules
- **period_closures**: Month-end reconciliation locks

### Key Constraints

- Postings must balance: `SUM(debit - credit) = 0` per transaction
- Only one period closure per date range
- Rules evaluated by priority (ascending); first match wins

## Packaging for Distribution

### Build Windows .exe

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller finance_app.spec
```

The packaged app will be in `dist/FinanceApp/`.

### Run the .exe

```bash
cd dist/FinanceApp
FinanceApp.exe
```

## Contributing

This is a portfolio project, but suggestions and improvements are welcome!

## Troubleshooting

### Import errors
Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Module not found: 'finance_app'
The app adds the parent directory to sys.path automatically. Run from project root.

### Charts not displaying
Ensure pyqtgraph is installed:
```bash
pip install pyqtgraph
```

### Database locked
Close any other instances of the app. SQLite supports single-writer only.
