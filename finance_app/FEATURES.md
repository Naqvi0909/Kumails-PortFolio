## üí° Interview Talking Points

### "What makes this unique?"
> "Most finance apps are web-based or mobile. This is a desktop app with local-first data, which means no cloud dependency, instant performance, and full data privacy. It's also open-source, so users can audit the code and trust their financial data."

### "How does it handle errors?"
> "At every layer. CSV import validates dates and amounts, skipping invalid rows. The rules engine uses try/catch for regex errors. Database operations use session management with automatic rollback on exceptions. The UI provides feedback via status labels."

### "Why double-entry bookkeeping?"
> "It's the foundation of all accounting systems‚Äîbanks, companies, personal finance apps. By implementing it, I demonstrate understanding of financial data models and constraints. It also ensures data integrity: every transaction must balance."

### "How would you scale this?"
> "For larger datasets, I'd add pagination to all views, not just transactions. Batch operations could move to background threads with progress bars. The database could migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for concurrent writes. Charts could use data sampling for 10,000+ points."
