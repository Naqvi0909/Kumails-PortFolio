## üîç Key Documentation Highlights

### Database Models (`models.py`)
```python
"""
Database models for the Personal Finance Reconciliation App.

This module defines all the SQLAlchemy ORM models that represent the database schema.
The models implement a double-entry bookkeeping system with transaction categorization.

Key Models:
- Account: Chart of accounts (assets, liabilities, income, expenses, equity)
- Transaction: Financial transactions from bank statements
- Posting: Double-entry bookkeeping entries (debits and credits)
- Category: Transaction categories for expense/income classification
- Rule: Automated categorization rules using regex patterns
- PeriodClosure: Month-end reconciliation locks

Database Design:
The schema follows double-entry bookkeeping principles where every transaction
creates balanced postings (total debits = total credits).
"""
```

### Double-Entry Logic (`posting_generator.py`)
```python
"""
Double-entry posting generator for the Finance App.

This module implements the core double-entry bookkeeping logic, automatically
generating balanced debit/credit postings for each transaction. This ensures
the fundamental accounting equation remains balanced: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

Double-Entry Rules:
- Expenses: Credit source account (money out), Debit expense account
- Income: Debit source account (money in), Credit income account
- Each transaction creates exactly 2 postings that must balance
"""
```

### Rules Engine (`rules_engine.py`)
```python
"""
Rules engine for automated transaction categorization.

This module implements a regex-based rules engine that automatically categorizes
transactions based on description patterns and optional amount ranges. Rules are
evaluated in priority order, and the first matching rule is applied.

Key Features:
- Regex pattern matching on transaction descriptions
- Optional amount range filtering (min/max)
- Priority-based rule evaluation
- Dry-run capability to preview matches
- Batch processing for performance
"""
```
